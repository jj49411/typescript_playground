 TypeScript

- Browser canâ€™t execute TypeScipt
- Extra error checking

- Run `tsc file_name` to invoke the typeScript compiler
- compile typescript file to JS

TypeScript adds
- Types. so we need to be more explicit about how things work/can avoid unnecessary errors
- Next-gen JavaScript features (compiled down for older browsers). like Babel, provides features in typescript that will be compiled down to JS file that works in older browsers
- Non-JavaScript features like Interfaces or Generics. helps during development that gives us clearer errors
- Meta-Programming features like Decorators
- Rich configuration options 
- Modern tooling that helps even in non-typescript projects
